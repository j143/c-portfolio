### üîÆ Future Projects

I'm constantly working on new tools and simulations. Some upcoming projects include:

- **Operational Amplifier Characteristics Analyzer**
- **Filter Design Interactive Tool** 
- **MOSFET Parameter Extraction Utility**
- **Circuit Noise Analysis Simulator**

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach

All projects are built with:

- **Modern Web Technologies** - React, TypeScript, modern CSS
- **Professional Development Practices** - Version control, automated deployment, responsive design
- **Educational Focus** - Clear interfaces, helpful documentation, learning-oriented design
- **Open Source** - All code is available for learning and collaboration

### üí° Project Philosophy

Each project is designed with three core principles:

1. **Educational Value** - Tools that help understand complex concepts
2. **Practical Utility** - Real applications for engineering work
3. **Code Quality** - Clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
